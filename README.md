# automate-PowerBI-simulation
This project demonstrates how to use Playwright to automate UI testing for a Power BI report. The script simulates real user interactions with the Power BI service to validate that report visuals refresh correctly after applying filters or interacting with slicers.

## Key Features
**Automates login using a saved auth session (auth.json).**
**Launches a specific Power BI report directly in the browser.**
**Simulates clicks on slicers/filters to trigger a data refresh.**
**Intercepts and validates QueryData API responses to confirm visuals are updated with the expected data.**
**Supports both headless (automation) and non-headless (debugging) execution.**

## Why Playwright?
Power BI visuals render dynamically and donâ€™t expose direct testing hooks. Playwright makes it possible to simulate real user actions (clicks, navigation, filtering) and capture the underlying data calls, ensuring end-to-end validation of report refresh behavior.
